## Introduction

Classifying iris flowers is a classic machine learning problem, and it's often used as an introductory example. This project focuses on using data analysis and machine learning to build accurate iris flower classification models. By following the steps outlined in this repository, that contains:

- Collecting and preprocessing iris flower data.
- Analyzing the dataset to gain insights.
- Selecting and implementing various machine learning classification models.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Making predictions on iris flower species.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `.csv` file. It includes measurements of iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the corresponding species labels.

## Data Analysis

Before building the machine learning models, a thorough data analysis is perfomed to understand the dataset better. Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualization can be found in the repo. 
## Machine Learning Models

A variety of machine learning classification models for iris flower classification has been employed. The models are implemented using popular libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. The models include:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
